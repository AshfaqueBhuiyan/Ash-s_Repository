Nymphaea caerulea, commonly called the blue lotus, blue water lily, or sacred blue lily, is a water lily native to the Nile region of Egypt and parts of East Africa. It is recognized by its striking blue petals and yellow center, floating gracefully on water surfaces. In ancient Egyptian culture, the blue lotus was associated with the sun, rebirth, and spiritual enlightenment, frequently depicted in art and religious symbolism.
